# scratch_former
Building a Transformer from Scratch

## Overview
This project implements transformer model from scratch in PyTorch, progressing through three versions with increasing complexity and features.

## Versions

### v1: Foundation
- Basic attention mechanism
- Projection layer
- Minimal architecture for understanding core concepts

### v2: Complete Flow
- Single attention head
- Single transformer block
- Full forward pass pipeline
- Foundation for scaling

### v3: Production Architecture
- Multi-head attention
- Multiple stacked blocks
- Complete transformer architecture
- Optimized for performance

## Dataset
Custom-prepared date conversion dataset used for training and evaluation across all versions.
